    "In the digital era, ensuring security and efficiency in document validation is crucial. LibreSign, a leader in digital signature innovation, redefines the experience by introducing document validation through QR Code. This article will discuss how this functionality not only reinforces security but also provides greater agility in verifying digitally signed documents.\n\nThe validation of digital signature authenticity is quick and easy with the scanning of the code on the document. This eliminates time-consuming and complicated processes, providing a straightforward verification experience.\n\nUsing QR Code for validation not only adds a layer of security but also promotes transparency by providing instant access to essential details such as date, time, and signer identification. This transparency builds trust among the involved parties and makes the process clearer and more effective.\n\nMoreover, LibreSign is compatible with various platforms, making document validation even more accessible. With the use of QR Code, it's possible to validate documents anywhere, whether on mobile devices or computers.\n\nAnother advantage of QR Code usage in LibreSign is the reduction of paper consumption. Since validation is done digitally, there's no need to print documents to validate signatures, contributing to environmental preservation.\n\nWith all these advantages, QR Code validation in LibreSign becomes an efficient solution for companies and individuals seeking a secure and swift way to validate digital documents. Don't waste time on bureaucratic processes; try LibreSign now to explore new paths in document verification.": "",
    "In the face of common challenges in digital signature processes, hybrid signatures present an effective solution. As a pioneer in this innovation, LibreSign provides its users with the flexibility to choose between using their personal digital certificate (e-CPF or e-CNPJ) or the system-generated certificate to sign documents from anywhere in the world.\nThe digital certificate, whether e-CPF or e-CNPJ, plays a fundamental role in electronic signatures. Acquired through a Certification Authority, it serves as an electronic identity that validates documents and the identity of the holder. Stored on devices like tokens, smart cards, or in the cloud, the certificate is essential for ensuring legitimacy in digital signatures.\nA unique feature of LibreSign is its ability to generate its own Certification Authority. By opting for this feature, users receive a certificate generated internally by the system, streamlining the process and adding innovation and efficiency. The Certification Authority self-generated by LibreSign provides a secure and efficient solution, aligned with the standards of ICP-Brasil.\nSecurity and legal validity are paramount in each signature carried out by LibreSign, ensuring compliance with the rigorous standards established by ICP-Brasil. This guarantees the authenticity and legality of each signed document, meeting and exceeding the expectations of businesses in various sectors, including government, education, and corporate enterprises.\n\nLibreSign is redefining the future of digital signatures, inviting you to be part of this revolution. Join us to explore a new level of experience in electronic signatures.": "",
