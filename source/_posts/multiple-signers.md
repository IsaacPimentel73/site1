With the evolution of commercial and legal demands, the need to allow a digital document to be signed by multiple individuals stands out. This capability not only speeds up workflow, ensures legal validity, and fosters collaboration among various stakeholders but also enables all involved parties to view and sign as needed, regardless of location or time zone.

Each digital signature is unique and linked to the signatory, ensuring the security, legal validity, and transparency of the document. Imagine, for example, a complex contract involving representatives from different departments of a company.
