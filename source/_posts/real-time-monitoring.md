### Real-time monitoring - Transform document management in public organizations with LibreSign

Managing documents efficiently and transparently is a constant challenge for many organizations, especially those in the public sector, where signing large volumes of documents is routine. The lack of visibility and control over the status of subscriptions can result in delays and a considerable loss of productivity, negatively impacting daily services and operations.

Imagine not being sure whether an important document has been signed or, even worse, discovering that it needs urgent action when it is already too late. This scenario not only generates frustration, but can also compromise the organization's efficiency and credibility. It is in this context that LibreSign stands out, offering a solution that provides total transparency and control over the document signing process.

### The main advantages of Real-time Monitoring with LibreSign

#### 1. Detailed and immediate follow-up

LibreSign's real-time monitoring allows you to track every step of the signing process. This means that at any time you can check whether a document has been signed or is still pending action. This immediate visibility is essential to ensure that documents do not stand still and that all parties involved meet their deadlines.

#### 2. Sending automatic reminders

When a document is pending signature, LibreSign allows you to send reminders to signatories. This functionality ensures that everyone is notified and can act quickly, avoiding unnecessary delays. In public organizations, where speed and precision are fundamental, this ability to automatically remember signatories is a very significant differentiator.

#### 3. Quick problem resolution

With real-time monitoring, problems can be identified and resolved immediately. By tracking the progress of documents, you can detect any obstacles or delays and take the necessary steps to correct the situation. This rapid response capability improves workflow efficiency and ensures documents are signed within established deadlines.

#### 4. Intuitive dashboard

LibreSign's interactive dashboard gives you a clear, detailed view of the status of each document. This intuitive interface facilitates the management and monitoring of multiple simultaneous signatures, allowing the team to focus on more strategic tasks, knowing that the system is taking care of document control and monitoring.

#### Why do public organizations need LibreSign?

Public organizations deal with large volumes of documents that need to be signed by different parties, often in different locations. Efficiency in managing these subscriptions is essential to keep administrative processes in order and ensure continuity of services. LibreSign not only speeds up the signing process, but also improves team organization and productivity by centralizing signature management in a single panel.

### Examples of real-time monitoring applications

1. **Government Departments:**

In government departments, where signing official documents is a daily activity, real-time monitoring ensures that all documents are signed in a timely manner and that no important details are overlooked.

2. **Hospitals and Health Services:**

In hospitals and healthcare services, efficient document management can literally save lives. The ability to monitor prescription and authorization signatures, prescriptions and other critical documents in real time ensures that patients receive the care they need without delays.

3. **Educational Sector:**

Schools, universities and other educational institutions can benefit from LibreSign by managing teacher contracts, parental consents, student records and other important documents efficiently and transparently.
